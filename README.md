**Main Purpose:**  Finding parts at affordable prices and making sure they are compatible with each other when building your PC is a problem. Our application aims to solve these problems.  

**Target Audience:**  Consumers and PC enthusiasts that are building their own PCs, especially ones in Turkey and neighboring regions where existing PC part compatibility and pricing applications provide limited or no support.  

**Key Features:**  
  - Users can register to the application for saving their PC builds and receiving notifications when products that are out of stock are available.  
  - Supports comparison of the price of a specific part (like processor, for example) among multiple websites.  
  - Informs the user when there’s incompatibility between parts.  
  - Has a built-in forum where users can discuss new computer parts and their experiences.  
  - Supports advanced sorting & filtering options.  
  - Comes with an easy-to-navigate UI and user-friendly UX  
  - Supports Turkey region  
  - Language support for Turkish & English

**Platform:** Android  

**Data Storage:** We will store the computer parts users choose and the computer builds they make. Also, built-in forum discussions will be stored. We are planning to use Firebase.  

**Unique Selling Point:** Websites like PcPartPicker exist, however they don’t support the Turkey region and they don’t provide information about second-hand (i.e. used) parts. Our application will support both features, while also supporting AI-powered suggestions which gives us an edge over other competitors.  

**Challenges:** Fetching data related to parts from manufacturers’ websites, checking the support between the parts and keeping up-to-date with the technology market.
